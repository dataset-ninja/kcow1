**kcow1** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 625 images with 1517 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *cow*, *house*, *truck*, and other: *car*.

Each image in the kcow1 dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (27 images), *valid* (52 images), and *train* (546 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/sungho).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
